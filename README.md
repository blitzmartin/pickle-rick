##### Thank you for reviewing this assignment!

The app has all the basic features:

- it is a single page application;
- on load, it fetches data from the given Rick&Morty API;
- it stores only 20 characters;
- the homepage shows a grid of cards;
- each card has at least character name, character image, number of episodes it was featured in;
- each card has an "add/remove to favorite" toggle function;
- through a searchbar you can filter only the queried input;

I have also added a "reset" button to clear quickly all the favorites.


The app has also 2 out of 3 bonus features:
- saves favorites locally with localStorage;
- with a checkbox you can see just the favorites;

It does not use Context.

####How to run the app

This project was created with Create React App. To run it locally, make sure you install the required packages executing 
`$ npm install` 

Then simply launch 
`$ npm start` 

The app will automatically open in your default browser.
